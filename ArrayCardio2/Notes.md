## Array Cardio 2

**Main Concepts**

1. some - Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value. 

2. every - Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

3. find - Returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.

4. findIndex - Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that no element passed the test.

5. splice - Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements (mutates the array).

6. slice - Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from begin to end (end not included) where begin and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
